## Description

Our group has sought to create an online platform, full of recipes and drinks - you'll actually want to make.
The goal was simple. As people who can appreciate great food and drink, we found that there was a real lack of online resources with simple, easy recipes 
from around the globe. We endeavoured to close that gap and create an intuitive space with the ability to save your favourite recipes for future reference.
The group assignment has taught us plenty - how to use GitHub correctly as a group, how to stay on top of pull requests and conflicts and how to use multiple API's to reach a desired outcome.

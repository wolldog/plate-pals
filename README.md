## Description

Our group has sought to create an online platform, full of recipes and drinks - you'll actually want to make.
The goal was simple. As people who can appreciate great food and drink, we found that there was a real lack of online resources with simple, easy recipes 
from around the globe. We endeavoured to close that gap and create an intuitive space with the ability to save your favourite recipes for future reference.
The group assignment has taught us plenty - how to use GitHub correctly as a group, how to stay on top of pull requests and conflicts and how to use multiple API's to reach a desired outcome.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
I initially opened the website to see how much of the work was done to match the acceptance criteria.
I then went ahead and developed the javascript code, HTML and CSS files
to implememnt the actual Work Day Scheduler

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:


![alt text](./assets/Screenshot.png)
![alt text](./assets/Screenshot_Of_Website_working.png)


## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
